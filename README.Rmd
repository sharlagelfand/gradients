## Phantom's Shadow

A recreation of [my piece made in procreate](https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/1418021325822701574) (which is a reinterpretation of [Odili Donald Odita's "Phantom's Shadow"](https://www.stevenson.info/exhibition/3088/work/3))

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A grid of 8 tiles down and 8 tiles across in various colours of teal mustard dark blue and salmon with a grey border. Some of the tiles are squares of solid colors. Some are rectangles with two squares combined, either horizontally or vertically, forming a gradient of their respective colors for example a gradient from salmon to dark blue."}
knitr::include_graphics("phantoms_shadow/phantoms_shadow.png")
```
