## Phantom's Shadow

A recreation of [my piece made in procreate](https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/1418021325822701574) (which is a reinterpretation of [Odili Donald Odita's "Phantom's Shadow"](https://www.stevenson.info/exhibition/3088/work/3))

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A grid of 8 tiles down and 8 tiles across in various colours of teal mustard dark blue and salmon with a grey border. Some of the tiles are squares of solid colors. Some are rectangles with two squares combined, either horizontally or vertically, forming a gradient of their respective colors for example a gradient from salmon to dark blue."}
knitr::include_graphics("phantoms_shadow/phantoms_shadow.png")
```

## Phantom

An interpretation of [Odili Donald Odita's "Phantom"](https://www.stevenson.info/exhibition/3088/work/2)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A grid of 8 tiles down and 8 tiles across in various colours of yellow, pink, orange, maroon, blue, and brown. Some of the tiles are squares of solid colors. Some are rectangles with two squares combined, either horizontally or vertically, forming a gradient of their respective colors for example a gradient from light yellow to pink or gold to orange."}
